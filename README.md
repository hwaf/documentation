Documentation for hwaf

# Introduction

This documentation explains how the Hwaf tools can be used whereas you are a client (user) of a software configured by Hwaf, or you are a software developper in a project configured using Hwaf, or you are managing a software base using Hwaf.
Parts of this documentation describe the architecture of the Hwaf tool, and a section list the detailed technical documents.

This documentation reflects in particular the conventions, usage adopted in the Atlas project, although most of the rules and recipes should be applied in other projects.

In addition there are in every section, some bits of comparisons with former recipes using the CMT tool. 

# Using hwaf as a software user

## Configuring the software base
### Selecting a work model

``hwaf`` supports multi-projects builds, where each project holds a number of interrelated packages. Projects have their own life (with specific build and installation areas).

Then the central tool in ``hwaf`` is the concept of the workarea where the current project resides. Locally checked out packages of this project will live.

To create such a workarea:

```sh
$ cd dev
# create a workarea named 'work'
$ hwaf init work
$ cd work
```

When you create a workarea, you can instruct it to use the definitions
and objects defined by other projects, using the ``hwaf setup``
command:

```sh
$ cd work
$ hwaf setup -p /path/to/a/project/install
```

Simple projects don't need that:

```sh
$ cd work
$ hwaf setup
$ hwaf show setup
workarea=/home/binet/dev/work
cmtcfg=x86_64-archlinux-gcc47-opt
projects=
```

### Configure the workarea
We can run the ``configure`` command to test whether all
dependencies are installed and generate the bootstrap code to be able
to compile:

```sh
$ hwaf configure
Setting top to                           : /home/binet/dev/work 
Setting out to                           : /home/binet/dev/work/__build__ 
Manifest file                            : /home/binet/dev/work/.hwaf/local.conf 
Manifest file processing                 : ok 
Checking for 'g++' (c++ compiler)        : g++ 
Checking for 'gcc' (c compiler)          : gcc 
================================================================================

```

By default, a workarea will hold
* a set of packages (each in its dedicated subdirectory)
* a common build area, meant tu receive the output of all build actions for all packages of the workarea.
* a common installation area
* a configuration script (a python script named hscript) automatically generated by the init command.

The hscript contains the steering mechanisms needed by hwaf to operate the various build, install, test actions in every package of the current project.

Although one may customize this script, generally speaking, only configuration specific scripts within each package need to be adpated. 

## Creating a package

Creating a package consists in adding a subdirectory inside the workarea.
