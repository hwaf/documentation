# Introduction

This documentation explains how the Hwaf tools can be used whereas you are a client (user) of a software configured by Hwaf, or you are a software developper in a project configured using Hwaf, or you are managing a software base using Hwaf.
Parts of this documentation describe the architecture of the Hwaf tool, and a section list the detailed technical documents.

This documentation reflects in particular the conventions, usage adopted in the Atlas project, although most of the rules and recipes should be applied in other projects.
